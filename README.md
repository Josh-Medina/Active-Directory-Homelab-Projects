# Welcome to the Active Directory Homelab Projects Repository!

This repository contains various projects related to Active Directory setup, configuration, and management on different platforms. Each project is designed to showcase specific aspects of Active Directory deployment and administration. 

The ultimate aim is to establish a trust relationship between the AD environments, creating a unified AD Enterprise environment. Eventually, I aim to leverage my skills and knowledge gained as a Penetration Tester to conduct targeted attacks on the Active Directory environment. 

Each project serves as a stepping stone towards gaining a comprehensive understanding of Active Directory and its vulnerabilities, preparing me for future security challenges.

The goal of these projects is to create an environment for:
- Testing
- Learning
- Innovation

This repository will be continuously updated as new projects are completed, providing resources for users to explore and learn from.
